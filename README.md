![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
Спасибо за участие в этом челлендже по фронтенд-кодингу

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
Челленджи помогают улучшить ваши навыки программирования путем создания реалистичных проектов

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Ваша задача — создать этот компонент QR-кода и сделать его максимально похожим на дизайн.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
Вы можете использовать любые инструменты, которые вам нравятся, чтобы помочь вам выполнить челлендж. Так что если у вас есть что-то, что вы хотите попрактиковать, не стесняйтесь попробовать.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.
Ваша задача — собрать проект из дизайнов в папке «/design». Вы найдете как мобильную, так и десктопную версию дизайна.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
Дизайны представлены в статическом формате JPG. Использование файлов JPG будет означать, что вам придется разумно подходить к таким стилям, как «размер шрифта», «отступы» и «поля».

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
Вы найдете все необходимые ресурсы в папке `/images`. Ресурсы уже оптимизированы.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
Существует также файл style-guide.md, содержащий необходимую вам информацию, например, цветовую палитру и шрифты.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:
Вы можете использовать любой удобный вам рабочий процесс. Ниже предложен примерный процесс, но не чувствуйте себя обязанными следовать этим шагам:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
   Посмотрите на дизайны, чтобы начать планировать, как вы будете выполнять проект. Этот шаг важен, чтобы помочь вам заранее подумать о CSS-классах для создания повторно используемых стилей.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
   Перед добавлением стилей структурируйте ваш контент с помощью HTML. Сначала написание HTML поможет сосредоточиться на создании хорошо структурированного контента.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
   Напишите базовые стили для вашего проекта, включая общие стили контента, такие как font-family и font-size.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
   Начните добавлять стили с верхней части страницы и двигайтесь вниз. Переходите к следующему разделу только после того, как вы будете удовлетворены тем, что завершили текущую область

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommended hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers.
Вы можете разместить свой сайт, используя одно из этих решений или любой другой из наших проверенных провайдеров. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.
-Мы настоятельно рекомендуем заменить этот README.md на свой собственный. Мы предоставили шаблон в файле README-template.md в этом стартовом коде.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.
-Шаблон предоставляет руководство о том, что добавить. Индивидуальный README поможет вам объяснить ваш проект и отразить ваши достижения. Пожалуйста, не стесняйтесь редактировать наш шаблон по своему усмотрению.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.
-После того как вы добавите свою информацию в шаблон, удалите этот файл и переименуйте файл README-template.md в README.md. Это сделает его файлом README вашего репозитория.
